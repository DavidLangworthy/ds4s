    "# 🌍 Day 4 – Mapping Biodiversity & Deforestation  \n",
    "### Advanced Visualization: Forest Loss Over Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, you’ll step into the **“run”** stage of the course. You’ll use Python and Plotly to create an **animated world map** that shows how forest cover has changed over the past 30 years — and what that means for biodiversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of the most **visually striking** and **high-impact** visualizations you’ll make. By the end of the lab, you’ll have created an interactive, time-lapse choropleth map that lets you watch deforestation unfold around the globe.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧭 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll explore one of the most important (and dramatic) sustainability issues: **habitat loss**. You’ll also build technical skills in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Geospatial data visualization** with country-level mapping\n",
    "- **Animated visualizations** using `plotly.express`\n",
    "- Interpreting **spatial and temporal patterns**\n",
    "- Connecting data to **biodiversity impacts**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 Tools & Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll use:\n",
    "- `pandas` for working with data\n",
    "- `plotly.express` for creating both static and animated maps\n",
    "\n",
    "All code runs in **Google Colab**, and we’ll ensure everything is installable with `pip`. You won’t need any GIS tools — Plotly handles geographic mapping using built-in ISO country codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Dataset: Global Forest Cover (% of land), 1990–2020\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re using an open dataset from the **FAO and World Bank**, which reports each country’s **percentage of land area covered by forest** every year.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Forest loss is a major cause of **biodiversity decline**\n",
    "- For each country and year, we’ll track the percentage of forest area\n",
    "- Example: Brazil’s forest cover has steadily declined due to Amazon deforestation; some countries have increased forest via reforestation\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is provided in a clean format:\n",
    "- `Country`, `ISO_code`, `Year`, `ForestPercent`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Lab: Mapping Deforestation and Habitat Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the notebook titled **“Mapping Deforestation and Habitat Loss”**. It will guide you through:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Exploring the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll start by loading the dataset and examining a single year (e.g. 2020). You’ll explore questions like:\n",
    "- Which countries have the most forest cover?\n",
    "- Which have the least?\n",
    "- What’s the global average?\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps you understand the scale of forest ecosystems — and the metric itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Static Map – Forest Cover in One Year\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you’ll create a **choropleth map** showing forest cover in 2020:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fig = px.choropleth(df_2020, \n",
    "                    locations=\"ISO_code\", \n",
    "                    color=\"ForestPercent\",\n",
    "                    hover_name=\"Country\",\n",
    "                    color_continuous_scale=\"Greens\",\n",
    "                    range_color=[0, 100],\n",
    "                    title=\"Forest Cover (% of Land) in 2020\")\n",
    "fig.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> This creates an interactive world map, where dark green = more forest, light green = less.  \n",
    "> You’ll be able to hover over any country to see exact values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Animated Map – Forest Change Over Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the exciting part: an **animated map** showing forest change from 1990 to 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll use `plotly.express` with `animation_frame='Year'`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fig = px.choropleth(forest_long_df,\n",
    "                    locations=\"ISO_code\",\n",
    "                    color=\"ForestPercent\",\n",
    "                    hover_name=\"Country\",\n",
    "                    animation_frame=\"Year\",\n",
    "                    color_continuous_scale=\"Greens\",\n",
    "                    range_color=[0, 100],\n",
    "                    title=\"Forest Cover (% of Land) by Country (1990–2020)\")\n",
    "fig.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> The map comes to life — you can play it like a video or move the year slider.  \n",
    "> Watch as regions like the Amazon and Southeast Asia **visibly lose forest** over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare the data, we’ve either:\n",
    "- Given you the dataset in **long format**, or\n",
    "- Shown you how to use `pd.melt()` to reshape it (with hints included)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Before-and-After Comparison (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also compare two specific years — e.g. 1990 and 2020 — by filtering the data and creating two static maps. This makes forest loss **even more obvious**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Prompt: “Which regions show the most dramatic change from 1990 to 2020?”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Interpreting the Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll reflect on what the map shows:\n",
    "- Which regions lost the most forest?\n",
    "- What does this mean for **wildlife** and **biodiversity**?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Deforestation is the **leading cause of habitat loss**, and the main driver of global biodiversity decline.  \n",
    "> You might connect specific regions to species under threat — like orangutans in Indonesia or jaguars in the Amazon.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll also highlight **positive trends** — countries that are regaining forest through reforestation efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💬 Discussion Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "- What trends do you see in deforestation over time?\n",
    "- How is this connected to economic development, agriculture, or population growth?\n",
    "- How might this visualization inform environmental policy?\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re not just making a map — you’re building a **data-driven story** about the planet’s forests, and what’s being lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 Starter vs. Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **starter notebook** includes lots of scaffolding, comments, and code templates — especially for reshaping and animating the data\n",
    "- The **solution notebook** shows the complete animated map and polished static comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "We also include hints for common issues:\n",
    "> “If your map is blank, check that your ISO codes are in 3-letter format (ISO-3) — Plotly requires this!”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ By the End of Today\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll be able to:\n",
    "- Visualize geospatial data using choropleth maps\n",
    "- Animate data over time using `plotly.express`\n",
    "- Interpret and narrate global patterns of deforestation\n",
    "- Connect spatial trends to sustainability and biodiversity impacts\n",
    "\n",
    "This is your most advanced and **visually impactful** chart yet — a mini story map that reveals how our ecosystems are changing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s build it.\n"
