    "Your task: **show how human-caused CO\u2082 emissions relate to global temperature rise**.  \n",

    "\n",
    "This is a **capstone project** \u2014 more open-ended than the earlier days. You\u2019ll:\n",
    "- Load and combine multiple datasets\n",
    "- Design a compelling visualization (or two)\n",
    "- Write a clear narrative explaining what you found\n",
    "- Build a mini-report you could share with others\n",
    "\n",
    "You\u2019ll work more independently, but still have prompts, examples, and a solution notebook to reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## \ud83d\udd27 Tools & Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use:\n",
    "- `pandas` for data handling\n",
    "- `matplotlib` or `plotly` for plotting (your choice!)\n",
    "- Google Colab as always \u2014 nothing new to install beyond what you\u2019ve used\n",

    "> **How do global CO\u2082 emissions relate to global temperature change?**\n",

    "### 3. Merging the Data\n",

    "```python\n",
    "df = pd.merge(df_co2, df_temp, on='Year')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now have a DataFrame with:\n",

    "- `CO2` (e.g. in gigatonnes)\n",
    "- `Temperature` (\u00b0C anomaly)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Visualization \u2013 Dual Line Chart\n",
    "\n",

    "- CO\u2082 emissions on one y-axis\n",
    "- Temperature on another y-axis\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> \ud83d\udca1 You\u2019ll add labels, a legend, maybe an annotation at 2020, and polish your chart. The goal is to clearly show how these two lines **rise together** \u2014 a powerful visual of cause and effect.\n",
