    "# 🌎 Day 1 – Visualizing Global Warming  \n",
    "### Introduction to Jupyter, Python, and Climate Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Day 1! Today is your first step into data storytelling with Python. You'll get familiar with **Google Colab**, learn how to load and explore a real dataset, and build your **first visualization** — a line chart showing how Earth’s temperature has changed over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll focus on one of the most important and well-documented trends in sustainability: **global warming**. By the end of this lab, you’ll be able to build a chart that shows the Earth's average temperature has risen **over 1°C since pre-industrial times**, using NASA climate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧭 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Today is all about the **crawl** stage — low stakes, high learning. You'll:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Get comfortable with **Google Colab** and Jupyter notebook cells\n",
    "- Learn the basics of **Python and pandas** for loading and inspecting data\n",
    "- Create your **first Matplotlib line plot**\n",
    "- Practice **labeling, annotating**, and describing your chart\n",
    "- Understand how a simple plot can tell a big story\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 Tools & Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re working in:\n",
    "- **Google Colab** (runs in your browser — no setup required)\n",
    "- **Python + pandas** for data handling\n",
    "- **Matplotlib** for plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything runs with standard libraries that Colab already has, or you can install with `pip` if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Dataset: NASA GISTEMP\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use real climate data from NASA’s [GISS Surface Temperature Analysis](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/). This dataset tracks **global surface temperature anomalies** each year — that is, how much warmer or cooler each year is compared to the 1951–1980 average.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is simple:\n",
    "- **One row per year**\n",
    "- A column with the temperature anomaly (in °C)\n",
    "\n",
    "That simplicity makes it perfect for our first visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Lab: Visualizing Global Warming\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll open the notebook called **“Visualizing Global Warming”**, which will guide you step-by-step through:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Setting Up\n",
    "You’ll import `pandas` and `matplotlib.pyplot`, and run a few test cells to make sure everything works.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🧠 Hint blocks are included to help you if anything doesn’t run.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Loading the Data\n",
    "You’ll load the NASA CSV file into a pandas DataFrame using `pd.read_csv(...)`. You’ll use `.head()` and `.columns` to explore the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example prompt: “What’s the most recent year in the dataset, and what was the temperature anomaly that year?”\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Creating Your First Plot\n",
    "You’ll create a **line chart** using `plt.plot(...)`, plotting `Year` on the x-axis and `Temperature Anomaly` on the y-axis. You’ll add:\n",
    "- A title\n",
    "- Axis labels\n",
    "- A horizontal line at 0°C for context\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🎯 This is the core moment: you’ll see the dramatic upward slope that shows global warming over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Improving the Chart (Optional)\n",
    "You’ll learn how to:\n",
    "- Highlight the most recent year with an annotation (e.g., “2024: +1.47°C”)\n",
    "- Use color and formatting to make the story even clearer\n",
    "\n",
    "> These are optional stretch goals — but give your chart polish and clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Interpreting the Story\n",
    "At the end of the notebook, you’ll write a short description in Markdown:\n",
    "- What does this chart show?\n",
    "- What does the trend mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "> For example: “Global temperatures have steadily risen. The last decade includes the warmest years on record, reaching ~1.47°C above the 20th-century average. This is strong visual evidence of climate change.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 Starter vs. Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **starter notebook** gives you structure, comments, and scaffolded code (`# TODO` prompts).\n",
    "- The **solution notebook** shows the completed version, in case you need a reference or get stuck.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ By the End of Today\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll know how to:\n",
    "- Use Colab notebooks\n",
    "- Load a CSV with `pandas`\n",
    "- Inspect and describe a dataset\n",
    "- Plot and label a basic chart with `matplotlib`\n",
    "- Tell a story about climate change using real data\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s a big first step. Let’s get started — open the notebook and press `Shift + Enter` to run the first cell.\n"
