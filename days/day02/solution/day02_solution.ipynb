    "# ⚡ Day 2 – Exploring Energy Trends  \n",
    "### Fossil Fuels vs. Renewables in a Warming World\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Day 2! Today you’ll go beyond the basics and learn how to compare **multiple variables**, build **multi-series plots**, and tell a more nuanced story about global energy trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our big question:  \n",
    "> **How has the global energy mix changed over time — and is renewable energy growing fast enough to fight climate change?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with all the progress in solar, wind, and hydropower, fossil fuels still make up about **85% of global energy use**. Today, you’ll use data to visualize both the progress and the gap that remains.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧭 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **“walk”** stage of the course. You’ll work more independently, but still with guidance and support. You’ll:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Practice loading and reshaping real-world data\n",
    "- Plot **multiple time series** in one chart\n",
    "- Create a **stacked area chart** to show energy mix over time\n",
    "- Use **bar charts** to compare countries\n",
    "- Learn to use **Seaborn** to make your plots clearer and more beautiful\n",
    "- Focus on framing a story with your visuals — not just showing data, but making it meaningful\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 Tools & Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll use:\n",
    "- `pandas` for data loading and manipulation\n",
    "- `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for plotting\n",
    "- Google Colab (as always) — no installation needed, just open and run\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll also see a few useful techniques like **filtering**, **grouping**, and possibly a light **list comprehension**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Dataset: Global Energy Mix 1965–2022\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll work with a **real dataset** compiled from BP and IEA sources, available publicly on Kaggle and other platforms. It tracks:\n",
    "- Global **renewable energy share** over time\n",
    "- Contributions from **hydropower, wind, and solar**\n",
    "- National data for a set of countries\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab, we’ll focus on:\n",
    "- Global trends over time\n",
    "- Composition of renewable energy sources\n",
    "- Cross-country comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Lab: Fossil vs. Renewable Energy\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll open the notebook called **“Fossil vs Renewable Energy”**, which will guide you through these projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Global Trends – Line Plot\n",
    "You’ll start by loading the global dataset and creating a simple **line plot** showing the rise of renewables over time — from about 5% of energy in 2000 to ~15% today.\n",
    "\n",
    "> You’ll use `seaborn.lineplot()` with nice styling and markers to make the chart pop.  \n",
    "> Optional: annotate the chart with milestones (like Paris Agreement or major tech breakthroughs).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Energy Composition – Stacked Area Chart (Optional)\n",
    "Next, you’ll explore **where renewable energy comes from** — hydro, wind, and solar. A **stacked area chart** will help you visualize how each part has grown.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This creates a rich, colorful graphic that shows how solar and wind are catching up to hydropower.  \n",
    "> You’ll see the energy mix **diversify over time**, not just grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide scaffolding to help you build this. You can do it! And if not, the solution notebook shows what’s possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Country Comparison – Bar Chart\n",
    "Then, you’ll look at how different countries are doing. You’ll use a prepared dataset for a recent year (like 2021) to compare **renewable energy share by country**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> You’ll create a **horizontal bar chart** using `seaborn.barplot()` or `barh()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might compare:\n",
    "- Top 5 leaders in renewable share (e.g., Norway, Brazil)\n",
    "- Big emitters with low renewables (e.g., US, China, India)\n",
    "\n",
    "> The story: Some countries are way ahead. Others have a long way to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Dual-Axis Plot (Stretch Goal)\n",
    "As a challenge, we’ll show how to build a **dual-axis chart** — one line for global energy demand, another for renewable share.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This gives extra context: Even as renewables grow, **total energy use is rising too**, which makes hitting climate goals harder.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is mostly prepared in the starter notebook so you can focus on understanding what it shows.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Storytelling Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "At key points, you’ll be asked to **interpret the data**:\n",
    "- How much have renewables grown?\n",
    "- Who’s leading and who’s lagging?\n",
    "- What does this mean for climate action?\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll connect your visual insights to big ideas:\n",
    "- Fossil fuels still dominate emissions (~75% of global GHGs)\n",
    "- Scaling up renewables is essential — not just for CO₂, but also for reducing local air pollution and health impacts\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 Starter vs. Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like yesterday:\n",
    "- The **starter notebook** walks you through each task with scaffolding and comments (e.g., `# TODO: plot multiple time series`)\n",
    "- The **solution notebook** shows polished versions of all plots — colorful, clear, and ready to be shared\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ By the End of Today\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll be able to:\n",
    "- Create multi-series and multi-category visualizations\n",
    "- Use Seaborn to improve plot readability\n",
    "- Compare global trends and country-level differences\n",
    "- Build high-impact graphics that show both progress and urgency\n",
    "\n",
    "This is your next step in becoming a data storyteller. Let’s go build some beautiful, meaningful plots.\n"
