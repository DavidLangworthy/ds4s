    "### How Air Quality and Economic Development Intersect\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we\u2019re diving into the relationship between **air pollution** and **economic development** \u2014 and how these two factors can reveal powerful patterns about global health and sustainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "You\u2019ll be working with **real data on PM2.5 exposure** (fine particulate air pollution) and **GDP per capita** (as a proxy for wealth) for countries around the world. Using these, you\u2019ll build an interactive chart that not only shows **where air pollution is worst**, but also why it\u2019s that way \u2014 and who is most affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## \ud83e\udded What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Today continues the **\u201cwalk\u201d** phase \u2014 and we start adding a few **\u201crun\u201d** elements by the end. You\u2019ll:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load and combine data from **multiple sources**\n",
    "- Create **scatter plots** to explore correlations between two variables\n",
    "- Use **Plotly Express** to build a beautiful, interactive **bubble chart**\n",
    "- Add extra dimensions to a chart using **color and size**\n",
    "- Practice **visual storytelling** by identifying patterns, trends, and outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## \ud83d\udd27 Tools & Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "You\u2019ll use:\n",
    "- `pandas` to load and merge datasets\n",
    "- `Plotly Express` to build interactive visuals\n",
    "- (Optional) `seaborn` or `matplotlib` for a quick static version\n",
    "\n",
    "All tools run in **Google Colab** \u2014 no installs needed beyond `pip install plotly`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## \ud83d\udcca Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "You\u2019ll use two cleaned, pre-aligned datasets (for the same year, e.g. 2019):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PM2.5 Exposure by Country** \u2013 average annual exposure to fine particulate matter (in micrograms per cubic meter), from the **Global Burden of Disease** dataset via the World Bank  \n",
    "- **GDP per Capita by Country** \u2013 in current USD, from the **World Bank World Development Indicators**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row is a country. You\u2019ll join the two datasets by country name to get:\n",
    "- `Country`, `PM25`, `GDP_per_capita`, `Population`, `Region`\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables a rich, multidimensional analysis \u2014 with just one chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Lab: Air Pollution vs. Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the notebook called **\u201cAir Pollution vs. Development\u201d**. It will guide you through:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Merging the Data\n",
    "You\u2019ll load the two CSV files and use `pd.merge()` to combine them.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For example: `merged_df = pd.merge(df_pm, df_gdp, on='Country')`  \n",
    "> A hint in the notebook helps with this if you get stuck.\n",
    "\n",
    "You\u2019ll end up with one DataFrame with everything you need to plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Quick Static Plot (Optional)\n",
    "You\u2019ll first make a **static scatter plot** using Seaborn or Matplotlib to explore the basic relationship:\n",
    "- X-axis: GDP per capita\n",
    "- Y-axis: PM2.5 levels\n",
    "\n",
    "> You'll likely see an **inverted U-shaped pattern**:  \n",
    "> Low-income countries have moderate PM2.5, middle-income countries often have the highest pollution, and wealthier countries tend to have cleaner air.\n",
    "\n",
    "This shape is sometimes called the **environmental Kuznets curve** \u2014 and it shows how pollution can rise during industrialization and fall again with better regulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Interactive Bubble Chart with Plotly\n",
    "Now comes the fun part: building a **fully interactive bubble chart** using `plotly.express`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You\u2019ll create a chart where:\n",
    "- X = GDP per capita (log scale)\n",
    "- Y = PM2.5 exposure\n",
    "- Size = population\n",
    "- Color = region\n",
    "- Hover = country name\n",
    "\n",
    "> Here's the structure you\u2019ll use (the notebook will guide you):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fig = px.scatter(merged_df, \n",
    "                 x='GDP_per_capita', y='PM25',\n",
    "                 size='Population', color='Region',\n",
    "                 hover_name='Country',\n",
    "                 log_x=True,\n",
    "                 title='PM2.5 vs GDP per Capita (2019)')\n",
    "fig.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "With this, you can:\n",
    "- Hover over each country to see exact values\n",
    "- Identify patterns and outliers\n",
    "- Explore disparities interactively\n",
    "\n",
    "This is your most modern visualization so far \u2014 and one you\u2019ll want to share.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Highlighting Key Points (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook may include a step to **highlight or annotate** key countries:\n",
    "- For example, **Bangladesh** (very high PM2.5), **Qatar** (high GDP and pollution), or the **U.S.** (high GDP, lower pollution)\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps tell a more pointed story: some countries have grown economically but haven\u2019t yet controlled air pollution; others have cleaned up their air through policy and innovation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Telling the Story\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the notebook, you\u2019ll answer a few reflective questions in Markdown:\n",
    "- What kind of relationship do you see between GDP and pollution?\n",
    "- Why might middle-income countries have the worst air quality?\n",
    "- What stands out in your chart?\n",
    "\n",
    "> \ud83d\udca1 Hint: Industrial growth (factories, cars, fossil fuels) tends to increase pollution before environmental protections kick in.\n",
    "\n",
    "This connects back to what you saw in Day 2: **reliance on fossil fuels drives both CO\u2082 and air pollution**. The path to sustainability isn\u2019t just about energy \u2014 it\u2019s also about health.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## \ud83e\uddea Starter vs. Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **starter notebook** walks you through the merge, the static plot, and scaffolds most of the Plotly code (with a few `# TODO` prompts).\n",
    "- The **solution notebook** shows a polished, colorful, fully interactive bubble chart, with example analysis and optional annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## \u2705 By the End of Today\n",
    "\n",
    "You\u2019ll be able to:\n",
    "- Join two datasets in `pandas`\n",
    "- Create rich scatter plots with multiple visual dimensions\n",
    "- Build an interactive chart using `plotly.express`\n",
    "- Analyze and narrate **correlations and inequalities** in public health data\n",
    "\n",
    "This is your first fully interactive, multivariate visualization. From here, you\u2019ll start to recognize visual patterns \u2014 and tell more human stories using data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let\u2019s get started.\n"
