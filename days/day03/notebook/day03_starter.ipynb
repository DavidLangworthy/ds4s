    "# 🌫️ Day 3 – Visualizing Pollution and Public Health  \n",
    "### How Air Quality and Economic Development Intersect\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we’re diving into the relationship between **air pollution** and **economic development** — and how these two factors can reveal powerful patterns about global health and sustainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll be working with **real data on PM2.5 exposure** (fine particulate air pollution) and **GDP per capita** (as a proxy for wealth) for countries around the world. Using these, you’ll build an interactive chart that not only shows **where air pollution is worst**, but also why it’s that way — and who is most affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧭 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Today continues the **“walk”** phase — and we start adding a few **“run”** elements by the end. You’ll:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load and combine data from **multiple sources**\n",
    "- Create **scatter plots** to explore correlations between two variables\n",
    "- Use **Plotly Express** to build a beautiful, interactive **bubble chart**\n",
    "- Add extra dimensions to a chart using **color and size**\n",
    "- Practice **visual storytelling** by identifying patterns, trends, and outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 Tools & Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll use:\n",
    "- `pandas` to load and merge datasets\n",
    "- `Plotly Express` to build interactive visuals\n",
    "- (Optional) `seaborn` or `matplotlib` for a quick static version\n",
    "\n",
    "All tools run in **Google Colab** — no installs needed beyond `pip install plotly`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll use two cleaned, pre-aligned datasets (for the same year, e.g. 2019):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PM2.5 Exposure by Country** – average annual exposure to fine particulate matter (in micrograms per cubic meter), from the **Global Burden of Disease** dataset via the World Bank  \n",
    "- **GDP per Capita by Country** – in current USD, from the **World Bank World Development Indicators**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row is a country. You’ll join the two datasets by country name to get:\n",
    "- `Country`, `PM25`, `GDP_per_capita`, `Population`, `Region`\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables a rich, multidimensional analysis — with just one chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Lab: Air Pollution vs. Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the notebook called **“Air Pollution vs. Development”**. It will guide you through:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Merging the Data\n",
    "You’ll load the two CSV files and use `pd.merge()` to combine them.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For example: `merged_df = pd.merge(df_pm, df_gdp, on='Country')`  \n",
    "> A hint in the notebook helps with this if you get stuck.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll end up with one DataFrame with everything you need to plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Quick Static Plot (Optional)\n",
    "You’ll first make a **static scatter plot** using Seaborn or Matplotlib to explore the basic relationship:\n",
    "- X-axis: GDP per capita\n",
    "- Y-axis: PM2.5 levels\n",
    "\n",
    "> You'll likely see an **inverted U-shaped pattern**:  \n",
    "> Low-income countries have moderate PM2.5, middle-income countries often have the highest pollution, and wealthier countries tend to have cleaner air.\n",
    "\n",
    "This shape is sometimes called the **environmental Kuznets curve** — and it shows how pollution can rise during industrialization and fall again with better regulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Interactive Bubble Chart with Plotly\n",
    "Now comes the fun part: building a **fully interactive bubble chart** using `plotly.express`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll create a chart where:\n",
    "- X = GDP per capita (log scale)\n",
    "- Y = PM2.5 exposure\n",
    "- Size = population\n",
    "- Color = region\n",
    "- Hover = country name\n",
    "\n",
    "> Here's the structure you’ll use (the notebook will guide you):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fig = px.scatter(merged_df, \n",
    "                 x='GDP_per_capita', y='PM25',\n",
    "                 size='Population', color='Region',\n",
    "                 hover_name='Country',\n",
    "                 log_x=True,\n",
    "                 title='PM2.5 vs GDP per Capita (2019)')\n",
    "fig.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "With this, you can:\n",
    "- Hover over each country to see exact values\n",
    "- Identify patterns and outliers\n",
    "- Explore disparities interactively\n",
    "\n",
    "This is your most modern visualization so far — and one you’ll want to share.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Highlighting Key Points (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook may include a step to **highlight or annotate** key countries:\n",
    "- For example, **Bangladesh** (very high PM2.5), **Qatar** (high GDP and pollution), or the **U.S.** (high GDP, lower pollution)\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps tell a more pointed story: some countries have grown economically but haven’t yet controlled air pollution; others have cleaned up their air through policy and innovation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Telling the Story\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the notebook, you’ll answer a few reflective questions in Markdown:\n",
    "- What kind of relationship do you see between GDP and pollution?\n",
    "- Why might middle-income countries have the worst air quality?\n",
    "- What stands out in your chart?\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 Hint: Industrial growth (factories, cars, fossil fuels) tends to increase pollution before environmental protections kick in.\n",
    "\n",
    "This connects back to what you saw in Day 2: **reliance on fossil fuels drives both CO₂ and air pollution**. The path to sustainability isn’t just about energy — it’s also about health.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 Starter vs. Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **starter notebook** walks you through the merge, the static plot, and scaffolds most of the Plotly code (with a few `# TODO` prompts).\n",
    "- The **solution notebook** shows a polished, colorful, fully interactive bubble chart, with example analysis and optional annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ By the End of Today\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll be able to:\n",
    "- Join two datasets in `pandas`\n",
    "- Create rich scatter plots with multiple visual dimensions\n",
    "- Build an interactive chart using `plotly.express`\n",
    "- Analyze and narrate **correlations and inequalities** in public health data\n",
    "\n",
    "This is your first fully interactive, multivariate visualization. From here, you’ll start to recognize visual patterns — and tell more human stories using data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s get started.\n"
