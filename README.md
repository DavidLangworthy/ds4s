# ðŸŒ¿ Data Visualization for Sustainability  ðŸŒ¿ 
### Week-Long Python & Colab Course

In this course, youâ€™ll learn how to use **Python** and **Jupyter/Colab notebooks** to create powerful, beautiful, and insightful visualizations about the planet.

You donâ€™t need to be a programmer â€” if you have a bit of stats background and a curiosity about sustainability, youâ€™re ready. This week is all about turning real-world environmental data into visual stories that matter. Think **climate change, renewable energy, air pollution, biodiversity loss** â€” and how you can use code and graphics to make those issues understandable, shareable, and impactful.

Youâ€™ll work entirely in **Google Colab** â€” a free, browser-based platform. Thereâ€™s nothing to install. Youâ€™ll use public, real-world datasets and open-source Python tools like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`. Every day, youâ€™ll work through an interactive notebook built around a hands-on project â€” one that teaches you a core technique and tells a real story about sustainability.

By the end of the week, youâ€™ll be able to create and share your own data-driven visual narrative â€” one that doesnâ€™t just show numbers, but helps people **understand what they mean**. Youâ€™ll know how to explore datasets, choose the right type of plot, build interactive charts, and turn data into insight.

This course is about **using code as a storytelling tool** â€” not mastering syntax, but mastering meaning. Letâ€™s get started.

## ðŸ“š Course roadmap

### Climate Change & Basic Plotting [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DavidLangworthy/ds4s/blob/master/days/day01/notebook/day01_starter.ipynb)
Wrangle global temperature records, practice time-series cleaning, and build line plots that reveal long-term climate trends.

*Turn raw NASA anomalies into a storytelling-ready climate trendline.*

### Fossil Fuels vs. Renewables [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DavidLangworthy/ds4s/blob/master/days/day02/notebook/day02_starter.ipynb)
Analyze energy mix data, compare categories with grouped bar charts, and calculate summary statistics that highlight trade-offs.

*Profile how the energy mix shifts by turning summary tables into clear comparisons.*

### Pollution and Public Health [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DavidLangworthy/ds4s/blob/master/days/day03/notebook/day03_starter.ipynb)
Join air-quality and health datasets, explore correlations with scatter plots, and interpret regression fits for policy insight.

*Spot inequities fast by pairing air-quality burdens with national wealth.*

### Biodiversity & Deforestation Mapping [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DavidLangworthy/ds4s/blob/master/days/day04/notebook/day04_starter.ipynb)
Work with geospatial data, design choropleth and interactive maps, and spot hotspots that tell a conservation story.

*Blend spatial joins and styling to surface where forest loss is most acute.*

### Capstone: COâ‚‚ Emissions & Global Temperature [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DavidLangworthy/ds4s/blob/master/days/day05/notebook/day05_starter.ipynb)
Combine multiple datasets, orchestrate multi-panel visuals, and narrate how emissions connect to global climate impacts.

*Synthesize multi-source data into a single narrative that links cause and effect.*

All notebooks now read from the datasets bundled in the [`data/`](data) directory so the lessons work completely offline.
