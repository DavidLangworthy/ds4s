# ðŸŒ¿ Data Visualization for Sustainability  ðŸŒ¿ 
### Week-Long Python & Colab Course

In this course, youâ€™ll learn how to use **Python** and **Jupyter/Colab notebooks** to create powerful, beautiful, and insightful visualizations about the planet.

You donâ€™t need to be a programmer â€” if you have a bit of stats background and a curiosity about sustainability, youâ€™re ready. This week is all about turning real-world environmental data into visual stories that matter. Think **climate change, renewable energy, air pollution, biodiversity loss** â€” and how you can use code and graphics to make those issues understandable, shareable, and impactful.

Youâ€™ll work entirely in **Google Colab** â€” a free, browser-based platform. Thereâ€™s nothing to install. Youâ€™ll use public, real-world datasets and open-source Python tools like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`. Every day, youâ€™ll work through an interactive notebook built around a hands-on project â€” one that teaches you a core technique and tells a real story about sustainability.

Each day follows a simple rhythm:  
> **Crawl** â†’ Youâ€™ll start with guided steps and lots of support.  
> **Walk** â†’ Youâ€™ll fill in key parts yourself with scaffolding and hints.  
> **Run** â†’ Youâ€™ll build something visually impressive and interpret what it means.

You'll have:
- **Starter notebooks** with explanations, prompts, and partially written code
- **Solution notebooks** so you can check your work or get unstuck
- Clear instructions, compelling datasets, and space to add your own voice

By the end of the week, youâ€™ll be able to create and share your own data-driven visual narrative â€” one that doesnâ€™t just show numbers, but helps people **understand what they mean**. Youâ€™ll know how to explore datasets, choose the right type of plot, build interactive charts, and turn data into insight.

This course is about **using code as a storytelling tool** â€” not mastering syntax, but mastering meaning. Letâ€™s get started.


## Repository layout

Each day's materials now live under `days/dayXX/` with two tracked notebooks:

- `solution/` contains the instructor version (`dayXX_solution.ipynb`).
- `notebook/` contains the autogenerated learner starter (`dayXX_notebook.ipynb`).

All datasets required by the notebooks are stored locally under `data/`, so learners no longer need network access to run the examples.

## Regenerating starter notebooks

Edit only the solution notebooks (for example, `days/day02/solution/day02_solution.ipynb`).
Before committing, run:

```bash
python tools/generate_starters.py
```

This script strips every `# --- Starter Notebook elide ... ---` section from the solutions and rewrites the learner notebooks. CI runs the same command in `--check` mode to make sure starters are never edited by hand.
